# K-Means
K-Means algorithm with OpenMP

## Important changes

* upgrade gcc version (currently 4.9.2)
* use latest OpenMP features after gcc upgrade (currently OpenMP 4.0)

## Less important

* stopping criterion
* mini-batch implementation

## Additional notes

* ~2x slower than Python scikitlearn's k_means (single threaded)
